Their only hope was that it would never stop raining, and they had no hope because
they all knew it would. When it did stop raining in Pianosa, it rained in Bologna. When
it stopped raining in Bologna, it began again in Pianosa. If there was no rain at all,
there were freakish, inexplicable phenomena like the epidemic of diarrhea or the
bomb line that moved. Four times during the first six days they were assembled and
briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when
the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they
suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue
raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars.
All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of
Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the
intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of
narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forwardmost position of the Allied ground
forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.
The morning after Hungry Joe's fist fight with Huple's cat, the rain stopped falling
in both places. The landing strip began to dry. It would take a full twenty-four hours
to harden; but the sky remained cloudless. The resentments incubating in each man
hatched into hatred. First they hated the infantrymen on the mainland because they
had failed to capture Bologna. Then they began to hate the bomb line itself. For
hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because
it would not move up high enough to encompass the city. When night fell, they
congregated in the darkness with flashlights, continuing their macabre vigil at the
bomb line in brooding entreaty as though hoping to move the ribbon up by the
collective weight of their sullen prayers.
'I really can't believe it,' Clevinger exclaimed to Yossarian in a voice rising and falling
in protest and wonder. 'It's a complete reversion to primitive superstition. They're
confusing cause and effect. It makes as much sense as knocking on wood or crossing
your fingers. They really believe that we wouldn't have to fly that mission tomorrow
if someone would only tiptoe up to the map in the middle of the night and move the
bomb line over Bologna. Can you imagine?
You and I must be the only rational ones left.'
In the middle of the night Yossarian knocked on wood, crossed his fingers, and
tiptoed out of his tent to move the bomb line up over Bologna.
